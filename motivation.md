# Motivation

## Why I'm Building This App

This personal finance application is born from several intersecting motivations that drive me to create something meaningful and educational.

### üéØ Primary Goal: Debt Freedom

The most immediate and practical motivation is **getting out of debt**. I want a tool that helps me:
- Track my debt obligations systematically
- Visualize my debt payoff progress
- Plan and optimize my debt repayment strategy
- Stay motivated by seeing clear progress toward financial freedom

This isn't just another budgeting app - it's a personal debt management system designed around my specific financial situation and goals.

### üíª Skill Development: Elixir & Phoenix

I'm using this project to **freshen up on Elixir and the broader ecosystem**. After some time away from the language, I want to:
- Re-engage with Elixir's functional programming paradigm
- Explore modern Phoenix LiveView patterns
- Practice with the BEAM virtual machine
- Build something substantial that demonstrates real-world Elixir usage

The financial domain provides rich opportunities to leverage Elixir's strengths in data processing, concurrency, and fault tolerance.

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è Infrastructure Playground: Kubernetes

This project serves as a **testing ground for Kubernetes** deployment and management. I want to:
- Containerize the Elixir application properly
- Set up Kubernetes clusters for development and production
- Practice infrastructure-as-code principles
- Learn modern deployment patterns and best practices

The financial application provides a realistic workload for testing scalability, monitoring, and operational concerns.

### üöÄ Test-Driven Development Journey

I'm committed to **test-driving this application into existence**. This means:
- Writing comprehensive tests from the start
- Using TDD to guide the design and architecture
- Ensuring high code quality and maintainability
- Building confidence in the codebase through thorough testing

The financial domain's complexity makes it an excellent candidate for demonstrating the value of comprehensive testing strategies.

## The Vision

This isn't just about building another app - it's about creating a tool that serves my immediate financial needs while providing a rich learning environment for modern software development practices. Each feature I build serves multiple purposes: solving a real problem, practicing Elixir, and exploring new technologies.

The journey from debt to financial freedom parallels the journey from concept to production-ready application. Both require discipline, planning, and consistent effort over time.
